Race condition 

The situation where two or more threads compete for the same resource, where the sequence in which the resurce is accessed is significant, is called race condition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critical section

A code section that leads to race condition is called critical section 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
preventing race conditions

To prevent race condition from occuring you must make sure that the critical section is executed as an atomic instruction. That means once a single thread is executing it, no other threads can execute it until the first thread has left the critical section

for eg if there is a banking system and there are two people one is depositing and other is withdrawing and total balance is 1000 and both or then w/d 500 and deposite 500 at the same time these are handles by two diff threads it will be a problem because two thread are trying to chnage the state of particular object atthe same time

Synchronization-

applying thread safety or applying lock also called as intrinsic loc or monitor lock
-------------------------------------
when is it required?

Its required if multifle threads are sharing the same resource (collections, data file ,db table)
------------------------------------------
how?

keyword --> synchorized (a lock is applied at the object level)

to avoid race condition, synchronization is required
-------------------------------------------
Synchronized method

A method with sync keyword allows only one thread at a time to let its task complete

a thread that comes first would take the lock and perform its times meanwhile other thread would wait for the first to complete the task

synchronized block

A block with sync keyword allows only one thread at a time to let its task complete

it follows the same concept as a sync method but it has limited scope as compared to method

the block is followed with an argument wrapping ref of an object.

it comes handy when less number of stmts require to be synchronized.
